# 🛍️ Tote Bag Tracker!! <3

Welcome to the **Tote Bag Tracker**! This tool was built to help you easily identify who has reached their class milestones (50, 100, 150, etc.) and who still needs to receive their bag.

## 📝 How it works
The app compares your **current student totals** against a **list of past recipients**. If a student has hit a milestone but their name isn't on the "already received" list, they will pop up on your list!

## 🚀 How to use it

### 1. Prepare your files
You will need two CSV files:
* **Booking System CSV:** This should be an export of your names. It must have a column for the **Name** and a column for the **Total Classes/Bookings**.
* **Email List CSV:** This is a list of people who have already received a bag. The app looks at the **first column** of this file for names.

### 2. Upload & Analyze
1.  Open the Streamlit link.
2.  Drag and drop your **Booking System CSV** into the left box.
3.  Drag and drop your **Email List CSV** into the right box.
4.  The app will instantly show you a summary of how many bags you need to prep!

### 3. Download your list
Once the table appears, click the **"Download Tote Bag List as CSV"** button to save a clean list of names and milestones to your computer.
